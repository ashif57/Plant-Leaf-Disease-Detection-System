# Plant Leaf Disease Detection System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **Plant Leaf Disease Detection System** using AI algorithms. The system is designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals by enabling early detection and intervention against plant diseases, thereby improving crop yield and quality.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Detection:** Utilizes advanced AI algorithms to accurately identify plant leaf diseases.
- **Early Intervention:** Helps in the early detection of diseases, allowing for timely treatment and intervention.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use by farmers and agricultural professionals.

## System Components
- **Data Collection:** Collects images of plant leaves from various sources for training and testing the AI model.
- **Model Training:** Trains a deep learning model to recognize different types of plant leaf diseases.
- **Prediction:** Uses the trained model to predict the disease from new plant leaf images.

## Key Technologies
- **TensorFlow:** For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Keras:** For designing and implementing the neural network architecture.
- **Python:** For scripting and integrating the various components of the system.

## How to Use
1. **Data Preparation:** Gather images of plant leaves and organize them into respective disease categories.
2. **Model Training:** Train the model using the prepared dataset to recognize different diseases.
3. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict diseases from new images of plant leaves.

## Benefits
- **Increased Crop Yield:** By detecting diseases early, farmers can take necessary actions to protect their crops.
- **Sustainable Agriculture:** Promotes sustainable farming practices through early intervention.
- **Cost-Effective:** Reduces the need for expensive treatments by catching diseases early.

This Plant Leaf Disease Detection System aims to revolutionize agricultural practices by leveraging AI technology for better crop management and disease control.
